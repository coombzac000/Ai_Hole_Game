# Ai_Hole_Game

How to play:
You control a cube, and you must avoid the oncoming walls by jumping through the holes. (Kinda like a reverse flappy bird, where the pipes move towards you instead of you moving towards them).

Feedback:

"You jump too fast to be precise"
- Changed the jumping high to be the right ammount

"There should be a game over screen or something"
- Added a game over screen (It used to just close the window when you die)

Ai reflection:

Pros:
- Specific questions with specific responces
- One single place, not a bunch of different websites
- Walking through and explaining it line by line
- Not having to sit through 800 videos

Cons:
- Sometimes gets stuff wrong
- If its not EXACTLY how the AI code is, its all gets messed (ex. A file name being slightly different messing up the entire project)
